# ACM0002 Baseline Study

## Overview
This document describes the baseline emissions calculation methodology for the Hedera Hydropower MRV project.

## 1. Grid Emission Factor (EF)
The Combined Margin (CM) emission factor is calculated as a weighted average of the Operating Margin (OM) and Build Margin (BM).

## 2. Baseline Electricity Generation (EG)
Baseline electricity is the amount of net electricity exported to the grid by the project activity.

## 3. Baseline Emissions Calculation
BE = EG * EF
